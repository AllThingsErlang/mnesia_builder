# mnesia_builder

Overview

Mnesia Builder is a versatile application designed to simplify and automate the deployment and management of Mnesia database tables. By leveraging a specification-driven approach, it abstracts the complexities of Mnesia's API, making it easier for administrators and developers to deploy clusters, manage tables, and perform database operations with ease.

The application empowers developers to dynamically create, use, and destroy tables with flexible field definitions, all while supporting optional field type enforcement for enhanced data integrity. Mnesia Builder facilitates seamless replication of cluster configurations across multiple environments.

Please note that Mnesia Builder is currently under active development. Features and functionality are being refined and expanded, and contributions or feedback are welcome to help shape its future.


Features

- Automates the deployment of Mnesia tables using a specification template for streamlined setup.
- Simplifies the deployment of clusters and tables while abstracting Mnesia table read/write operations.
- Allows administrators to replicate Mnesia cluster configurations across multiple deployments seamlessly.
- Enables applications to dynamically create, use, and destroy tables. Applications can define any table type with any set of fields without dealing with the complexities of the Mnesia API syntax.
- Provides optional enforcement of table field types for added data integrity.
